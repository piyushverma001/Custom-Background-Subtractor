# Custom-Background-Subtractor
Image pre-processing is an important step in Machine Learning. Most of the times there is a need of background subtractor to extract important features only. This is a coustomisable background subtractor made using opencv-python which can remove background from video feed. You can additionaly change the coordinnates of Region of Interest as commented in code to remove background of desired area only.
This can have multiple uses as in one of my projects where you can play Rock, Paper, Scissor with the computer.
Hope it helps :)
